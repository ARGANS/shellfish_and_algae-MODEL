   abstract = {A dynamic growth model is presented for the suspension-feeding scallop Chlamys farreri. The model is configured and validated for C. farreri cultured in Sungo Bay, China, using functional relations to simulate rapid and sensitive adjustments in feeding and metabolism as observed in response to the highly changeable environment there. Notable novel elements include resolving significant adjustments in the relative processing of living chlorophyll-rich phytoplankton organics, non-phytoplankton organics and the remaining inorganic matter during both differential retention on the gill and selective pre-ingestive rejection within pseudofaeces. We also include a facility to predict the energy content of non-phytoplankton organics. This is significant, for living phytoplankton contributed less than 20% towards suspended particulate organic matter within Sungo Bay. Further, the energy content of non-phytoplankton organics was very much more variable than for phytoplankton organics. Whether using that facility or assuming an average value for the energy content of non-phytoplankton organics, resolution of the relative processing of different particle types allows simulation of how the rates, organic compositions and energy contents of filtered, ingested and deposited matter change in response to differences in seawater temperature, seston availability and seston composition. Dependent relations predict rates of energy absorption, energy expenditure and excretion. By these means, our model replicates dynamic adjustments in feeding and metabolism 0022-0981/02/$-see front matter D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This is an important advance compared with simpler models that do simulate responsive adjustments. Only by modelling the complex set of feedbacks, both positive and negative, whereby suspension feeding shellfish interact with ecosystem processes, can one realistically hope to assess environmental capacities for culture.},

@article{Hawkins2013,
   abstract = {Previous shellfish models have, in general, been calibrated for 1 location, unable to simulate growth across habitats that contrast in seston abundance and composition, as may vary between turbid, eutrophic and oligotrophic waters. Here, we describe the generic shellfish model ShellSIM, demonstrating how a common parameter set simulates growth effectively on calibration in the mussel Mytilus edulis and oyster Crassostrea gigas during normal culture across 9 different locations in Europe and China. Options enable the user to assess the relative values of chlorophyll a (CHL, measured in micrograms per liter), total particulate organic matter (POM; measured in milligrams per liter), and total particulate organic carbon (POC; measured in milligrams per liter) as codescriptors of the food available at separate locations. Using CHL as the sole proxy for available organics, together with an average carbon-to-CHL ratio of 50, growth in both M. edulis and C. gigas was predicted accurately at only 5 locations, primarily those with relatively low average food availability. In contrast, more than 74% of the observed variance in growth was predicted across all 9 locations in each species on inclusion of dynamic relations defining ingestion and absorption of both CHL-rich and all remaining organic matter such as may include bacteria, protozoans, colloids, and/or detritus, thereby helping to account for temporal and spatial changes in dietary composition. The energy content of the remaining organic matter (measured in Joules per milligram) ranged seasonally across all sites from about 2–25 J/mg, and could be predicted with growth from the relative abundance of CHL and POM alone, proving a viable alternative to more technically demanding measures of POC. Fractional contributions of the remaining organic matter to the energy absorbed in both species at each location ranged from less than about 0.4 during the spring to more than 0.8 from late autumn, in negative relation with CHL, thus helping to offset tissue wasting during winter months. We acknowledge model uncertainties, emphasizing the need to balance practicality and affordability against required accuracies. Last, we describe how the generic and multi-site capabilities afforded by ShellSIM, together with real-time outputs ready for integrated modeling of how shellfish influence ecosystem properties and processes, are saving time and resources across a variety of applications.},

@article{Pleissner2012,
   abstract = { We have investigated changes in specific contents of protein, glycogen and lipid, and fatty acids of blue mussels, Mytilus edulis , under different conditions in the field and in laboratory feeding experiments using different microalgae. Specific contents of glycogen and lipid increased in mussels relocated to net bags at a location in Kerteminde Bay (Great Belt, Denmark) in contrast to mussels relocated to a location in Sallingsund (Limfjorden, Denmark). The polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, reached 3 times higher values in the mussels in Kerteminde Bay. Mussels fed pure cultures of Crypthecodinium cohnii , which is rich in the polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and glycogen, gained the highest specific contents of this fatty acid and glycogen. Mussels feeding on the most protein rich of the microalgae, Bracteacoccus sp., gained the highest protein contents. The specific glycogen content of the mussels was influenced by their “condition” (body dry weight/shell length ratio) while specific protein and lipid contents were not. Starvation affected mainly the specific glycogen content. These results show that biomass composition of blue mussels is affected by living site and local phytoplankton species and that the fatty acids composition of mussels reflects the content of fatty acids in the diet. },

   abstract = {The shell color of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a desirable trait; but the nutritional studies on C. gigas with different shell colors have not been conducted. Through successive selective breeding, five shell color strains of black (B), purple (P), orange (O), golden (G) and white (W) C. gigas have been developed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition and nutritional value of five shell color strains and one commercial population with a common color. The biochemical composition including moisture, total protein, glycogen, ash, total fat, fatty acids (FA), amino acids and minerals was detected. The results indicated that the protein (50.76%-56.57%) was the major component. The content of glycogen showed a significant difference between orange shell and golden shell strains, as well as between commercial population and golden shell strain. In addition, all shell color strains contained a large amount of essential amino acids (12.20-14.15 g (100 g) −1), of them leucine (2.81-3.29 g (100 g) −1) and lysine (2.79-3.28 g (100 g) −1) were predominant. The oysters were rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (42.26%-45.24% of total fatty acid) with high levels of DHA (18.53%-21.16% of total fatty acid) and EPA (17.23%-18.68% of total fatty acid). Significant differences of mineral contents (Mg, Zn, Fe and Cu) were identified among the six populations. These results indicated that C. gigas with different shell colors presented rich nutritional value with high protein, glycogen, essential amino acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The biochemical composition obtained in this study is useful for selective breeding of C. gigas with different shell colors.},
