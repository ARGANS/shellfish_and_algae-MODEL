   abstract = {The aim of this work was to develop a model capable of simulating the gross and the net growth of Enteromorpha sp. in tidal estuaries. The model was developed for the Mondego Estuary (Western Portugal) taking into account the key factors that control green macroalgae in the area. Enteromorpha gross growth was defined as a function of light, temperature, salinity and internal nutrients (N and P). Net growth was defined as gross growth minus respiration. The model was calibrated using a set of experimental data obtained in the laboratory under semi-controlled conditions. Sub-models of tidal height and light extinction coefficient variation were included for predicting macroalgal growth in the field, which constituted the model validation. According to the results, model predictions are well within the observed results, both in the laboratory and in the field. The largest discrepancies between predicted and observed values in the field refer to winter months and July. Possibly at these periods of the year, the prevailing external conditions (very low salinity in winter and high temperature and PFD in July) induced some physiological responses by Enteromorpha, which were not described by the model (e.g. sporulation, desiccation). The model was also used to demonstrate the need to consider dynamic descriptions of the light extinction coefficient in the water column (k) when assessing primary productivity in tidal environments. If macroalgal-specific (e.g. nutrient internal status) and site-specific parameters (e.g. minimal and maximal depth, photoperiod) are considered, the present model may be used in a broader scale. ©2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is being explored on both economic and environmental grounds in many traditional aquaculture regions. To test a variety of suitable macroalgae species and management scenarios, a numerical model is developed to quantify the remediation of dissolved nutrients and production of macroalgae near a nutrient source. Differences in the morphological, physiological, and economic characteristics of different macroalgae species can provide flexibility when considering the cost and benefit of farming macroalgae. Results show that of the three species studied, Macrocystis pyrifera removed 75 % of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) input from a point source, while Porphyra umbilicalis and Ulva lactuca removed 5 %. Both M. pyrifera and P. umbilicalis have reduced bioremediation capacity at increasing flow rates. U. lactuca showed increased bioremediation potential as flow rate increased from low to moderate flows. Increasing the optical depth increased the bioremediation potential of M. pyrifera for moderate values of the light attenuation coefficient, whereas bioremediation was unaffected by optical depth for both U. lactuca and P. umbilicalis. Harvesting increased bioremediation capacity of all species by up to 25-fold dependent on the establishment phase and harvesting frequency. We conclude that the choice of macroalgae species greatly affects the success of IMTA and that both harvesting and farm arrangements can be used to greatly optimize bioremediation.},

Here, we develop a multi-scale model for Ulva sp. macroalgae growth and nitrogen sequestration in an intensive cultivation farm, regulated by temperature, light, and nutrients. The model incorporates a range of scales by incorporating spatial effects in two steps: light extinction at the reactor scale (1 m) and nutrient absorption at the farm scale (1 km). The model was validated on real data from an experimental reactor installed in the sea. Biomass production rates, chemical compositions, and nitrogen removal were simulated under different seasons, levels of dilution in the environment and water-exchange rate in the reactor. This multi-scale model provides an important tool for environmental authorities and seaweed farmers who desire to upscale to large bioremediation and/or macroalgae biomass production farms, thus promoting the marine sustainable development and the macroalgae-based bioeconomy.},

   abstract = {This paper has not been submitted elsewhere in identical or similar form, nor will it be during the first three months after its submission to Hydrobiologia. 2 Abstract The results of a modelling study to investigate the mechanisms controlling macro-algal growth within the Medway estuary, UK, are presented. Intertidal zone bathymetry, tidal dynamics, and turbidity, control the time available for nutrient uptake and photosynthesis, and were used as a basis for predicting areas where macroalgae will grow. Tidal bed stress was also considered as a controlling factor for the presence of the less robust green macroalgae species. Two approaches to predicting macroalgal distributions were applied. A 'Suitability Index' method, based on the proportion of the tidal cycle that the seabed, at a given location, was inundated but within the photic zone, and a full biological macro-algal growth model that, in addition, includes the nutrient uptake. While the former approach simply assigns a value between zero and one for the suitability of a location for macro-algal occurrence, the growth model is able to give predictions of biomass over an annual cycle. The results were compared with aerial maps of vegetation cover, and time series of observed biomass. Both approaches gave good predictions of non species-specific vegetation cover in the intertidal zone of the Medway. Tidal bed stress was found to be a strong predictor of the specific occurrence of Enteromorpha spp. and Ulva spp., with these species favouring areas of low tidal energy. It was concluded that light, and lack of suitable regions with low tidal bed stress rather than nutrients was the main factor limiting excessive growth of Enteromorpha spp. and Ulva spp., in the estuary. 3},

@article{Solidoro1997,
   abstract = {The paper describes the definition and a first parametrization of a dynamic model of macroalgae (Ulva rigida) population. Based on specific literature, a two-step kinetic scheme is selected for modelling growth and uptake of nitrogen and, therefore, the intratissual concentration of nitrogen has been considered as a state variable of the model. Accordingly, Ulva r. growth rate depends on the concentration of phosphorus in the external medium and on the intratissual nitrogen concentration, which influences, in turn, the uptake rates of reduced and oxidized nitrogen. The influences of temperature and light intensity on Ulva r. photosynthetic activity are also discussed. The dynamics of dissolved oxygen has also been modelled and a specific mortality rate, depending on dissoved oxygen, has been adopted. The model has proved to be qualitatively consistent with the available literature, while a first parametrization yields results in quantitative agreement with short term laboratoy experiments, regarding samples collected in the lagoon of Venice. The model has been applied to data sets collected in the lagoon of Venice and is capable of reproducing the main features of the seasonal dynamic of Ulva r. These results prompted its inclusion in a comprehensive 3D transport-water quality model of the Venice lagoon ecosystem.},

   abstract = {Displacing fossil fuels with renewables and increasing sustainable food and chemicals production are among the major challenges facing the world in the coming decades. Integrating climatological oceanographic data with a metabolism and growth rate model of the green marine macroalga from Ulva genus, we analyze the potential of offshore biorefineries to provide for biomass, ethanol, butanol, acetone, methane and protein, globally and in 13 newly defined offshore provinces. We show that for optimum fresh weight stocking density of 4 kg m-2 the total potential of offshore cultivated Ulva biomass is of the order of 1011 dry weight (DW) ton year-1, over a surface area of ~108 km2. We found that the distance of the offshore cultivation site to the processing facility is limited to 114-689 km, depending on cargo moisture content. The near-future technologically deployable areas, associated with up to 100 m water installation depth, and 400 km distance from the shore, can provide for 109 DW ton year-1, which is equivalent to ~18 EJ. This has the potential to displace entirely the use of fossil fuels in the transportation sector or provide for 5-24% of predicted plant proteins demand in 2054. In addition, we modeled the potential production of ethanol, butanol, acetone and methane from the offshore produced biomass. Finally, we analyzed the environmental risks and benefits of large-scale offshore macroalgal cultivation. These results are important as they show for the first time the potential of offshore biomass cultivation to reduce the use fossil fuels and arable land to provide for food, chemicals and fuels required for the society.},

   abstract = {There is increasing interest in macroalgae farming in European waters for a range of applications, including food, chemical extraction for biofuel production. This study uses a 3-D numerical model of hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry to investigate potential production and environmental effects of macroalgae farming in UK and Dutch coastal waters. The model included four experimental farms in different coastal settings in Strangford Lough (Northern Ireland), in Sound of Kerrera and Lynn of Lorne (north-west Scotland) and in the Rhine plume (the Netherlands), as well as a hypothetical large-scale farm off the UK north Norfolk coast. The model could not detect significant changes in biogeochemistry and plankton dynamics at any of the farm sites averaged over the farming season. The results showed a range of macroalgae growth behaviours in response to simulated environmental conditions. These were then compared with in situ observations where available, showing good correspondence for some farms and less good correspondence for others. At the most basic level, macroalgae production depended on prevailing nutrient concentrations and light conditions, with higher levels of both resulting in higher macroalgae production. It is shown that under non-elevated and interannually varying winter nutrient conditions, farming success was modulated by the timings of the onset of increasing nutrient concentrations in autumn and nutrient drawdown in spring. Macroalgae carbohydrate content also depended on nutrient concentrations, with higher nutrient concentrations leading to lower carbohydrate content at harvest. This will reduce the energy density of the crop and thus affect its suitability for conversion into biofuel. For the hypothetical large-scale macroalgae farm off the UK north Norfolk coast, the model suggested high, stable farm yields of macroalgae from year to year with substantial carbohydrate content and limited environmental effects.},

@article{Monteiro2021,
   abstract = {The sugar kelp Saccharina latissima experiences a wide range of environmental conditions along its geographical and vertical distribution range. Temperature and salinity are two critical drivers influencing growth, photosynthesis and biochemical composition. Moreover, interactive effects might modify the results described for single effects. In shallow water coastal systems, exposure to rising temperatures and low salinity are expected as consequence of global warming, increased precipitation and coastal run-off. To understand the acclimation mechanisms of S. latissima to changes in temperature and salinity and their interactions, we performed a mechanistic laboratory experiment in which juvenile sporophytes from Brittany, France were exposed to a combination of three temperatures (0, 8 and 15°C) and two salinity levels (20 and 30 psu (practical salinity units)). After a temperature acclimation of 7 days, sporophytes were exposed to low salinity (20 psu) for a period of 11 days. Growth, and maximal quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), pigments, mannitol content and C:N ratio were measured over time. We report for the first time in S. latissima a fivefold increase in the osmolyte mannitol in response to low temperature (0°C) compared to 8 and 15°C that may have ecological and economic implications. Low temperatures significantly affected all parameters, mostly in a negative way. Chlorophyll a, the accessory pigment pool, growth and Fv/Fm were significantly lower at 0°C, while the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle was increased at both 0 and 8°C compared to 15°C. Mannitol content and growth decreased with decreased salinity; in contrast, pigment content and Fv/Fm were to a large extent irresponsive to salinity. In comparison to S. latissima originating from an Arctic population, despite some reported differences, this study reveals a remarkably similar impact of temperature and salinity variation, reflecting the large degree of adaptability in this species.},

The aim was to relate carbon and nitrogen masses of the algae to a simple and rapid morphological measurement of the total length of the sporophyte. These relationships were highly significant and appeared very useful to express the standing biomass of L. saccharina in terms of carbon or nitrogen and then to consider dynamic processes such as primary production. Variations in tissue carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) were examined over a complete seasonal cycle. Average carbon and nitrogen content ranged from 23.9 to 31.4% and 2.23 to 3.42% of the total dry weight, respectively. Variations in C/N ratio showed a clear seasonal pattern with an increase in the early spring corresponding to strong photosynthesis and growth.},

   abstract = {Kelps are important foundation species in coastal ecosystems currently experiencing pronounced shifts in their distribution patterns caused by ocean warming. While some populations found at species’ warm distribution edges have been recently observed to decline, expansions of some species have been recorded at their cold distribution edges. Reduced population resilience can contribute to kelp habitat loss, hence, understanding intraspecific variations in physiological responses across a species’ latitudinal distribution is crucial for its conservation. To investigate potential local responses of the broadly distributed kelp Saccharina latissima to marine heatwaves in summer, we collected sporophytes from five locations in Europe (Spitsbergen, Bodø, Bergen, Helgoland, Locmariaquer), including populations exposed to the coldest and warmest local temperature regimes. Meristematic tissue from sporophytes was subjected to increasing temperatures of Δ+2, Δ+4 and Δ+6°C above the respective mean summer temperatures (control, Δ±0°C) characteristic for each site. Survival and corresponding physiological and biochemical traits were analyzed. Vitality (optimum quantum yield, Fv/Fm) and growth were monitored over time and biochemical responses were measured at the end of the experiment. Growth was highest in northern and lowest in southern populations. Overall, northern populations from Spitsbergen, Bodø and Bergen were largely unaffected by increasing summer temperatures up to Δ+6°C. Conversely, sporophytes from Helgoland and Locmariaquer were markedly stressed at Δ+6°C: occurrence of tissue necrosis, reduced Fv/Fm, and a significantly elevated de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (DPS). The variations in phlorotannins, mannitol and tissue C and N contents were independent of temperature treatments and latitudinal distribution pattern. Pronounced site-specific variability in response to increasing temperatures implies that exceeding a threshold above the mean summer temperature exclusively affect rear-edge (southernmost) populations.},

   abstract = {Growth dynamics of Saccharina latissima in a Danish embayment (56°03.793N, 10°16.148E) were investigated through an annual cycle (March 1999-March 2000) and related to patterns found in previous studies covering the distribution range of the species. The kelps exhibited meristematic growth as well as distal tissue loss all year around. Elongation rate peaked in spring (March-May, 0.75 cm day-1), whereas maximum biomass growth occurred in May-July at higher insolation. S. latissima accumulated nitrogen (N) in November-March, when ambient N levels were high and the fast growth in March-July was followed by a depletion of these reserves. Light regimes and seasonal fluctuations of nutrients were, thus, major factors explaining the seasonal growth pattern of S. latissima in this temperate bay. Differences in light and exposure along depth gradients affected the growth, loss and storage product dynamics. High losses of N and carbon (C) through summer abscission of distal tissue question the efficiency of translocation, especially at shallower depths, where losses are accelerated by, e.g., high temperature. A large-scale comparison further highlighted that warming advanced the timing, increased the level of peak growth and also seemed to expand the growth period. Growth rates of the studied Danish population fell in the low end of the range for similar latitudes and temperatures, probably due to sub-optimal salinities (avg. 23.3 psu) in combination with periodically high summer temperatures (max. 21.1 °C). © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
